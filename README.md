# MicroSocks - Ultra-light, highly recommended

===========================================================

- To save everyone's time, I have prepared a small bash script, copy the command below, press Enter once and you're done.

```
wget -qO microsocks.sh https://go.bibica.net/microsocks && sudo bash microsocks.sh

```

- **Each time the script runs, ports, users, and passwords are randomly generated**
- Logging is disabled.
- The `auth_once` feature is enabled.
