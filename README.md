MicroSocks - highly recommended
===========================================================

- To save everyone's time, I have prepared a small bash script, copy the command below, press Enter once and you're done.

```
wget -qO microsocks.sh https://go.bibica.net/microsocks && sudo bash microsocks.sh

```

- Run via docker, randomize account and password, disable logging, enable auth_once
